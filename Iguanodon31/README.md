# Iguanodon31

**This an old package used for specific project, we are now working on a clean and nice version with a sligthly less random name** 

The Iguanodon31 object (please email Boris Gailleton about the stupid name) is used to automate various topographic analyses using https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/[LSDTopoTools]. 

You will need to set the directories of both the *LSDTopoTools* objects and the https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_visualisation.html[LSDMappingTools] pacakges within the file `config.config`.
